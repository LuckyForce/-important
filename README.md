# important README

This is a simple extension that also only contains a single file with 12 lines of json data.

The use of the extension is simple: It helps you to write "!important" quicker with the help of one snippet.

The motivation for this extension was that I often wanted to write a "!important" in my css but I always tried to automatically autocomplete it with my snippets but there where no famous css snippet extensions that provided the "!important" snippet.

I therefore decided to create this extension. It might not be really useful but I think it actually could save me some time.

## Features

Creates an "!important" in your css with the help of one snippet.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release of !important.
